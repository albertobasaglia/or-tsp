\begin{abstract}
	The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization.
	It asks the following question:\\\\
	\textit{Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route 
	that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?}\\\\
	TSP is computationally difficult (NP-Hard), but there exist many \textit{heuristics} and \textit{exact algorithms} to solve it.
	In this thesis we are going to show and compare the performances of these algorithms.

\section{Introduction}
In this study we focus on evaluating the performance of two heuristic algorithms: the \textit{Greedy} algorithm with \textit{2-opt} 
optimization and the \textit{Tabu Search} algorithm.
The Greedy algorithm, starting from every possible node of the instance, tries to find the optimal solution always updating the path
with the closest node. To improve the performance of this algorithm, after that, we apply also the 2-opt algorithm, to remove 
the intersection between the edges of the path.
On the other hand, the Tabu Search algorithm, starting from a random node, tries to `move`... TODO
